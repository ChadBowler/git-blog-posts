# When to Use Static Generation vs. Server-side Rendering

When building a web application, one of the most important decisions you will make is how to render your pages. There are two main approaches to page rendering: static generation and server-side rendering.

**Static generation** renders the entire HTML page on the server before it is sent to the client. This means that the client's browser does not have to do any work to render the page, which can improve performance. However, static generation is not as flexible as server-side rendering, because it is not possible to dynamically generate content based on user input.

**Server-side rendering** renders the HTML page on the server on demand. This means that the page is rendered every time a user requests it. This can be slower than static generation, but it is more flexible, because it is possible to dynamically generate content based on user input.

So, when should you use static generation and when should you use server-side rendering? Here are some things to consider:

* **Performance:** Static generation is generally faster than server-side rendering, because the page is only rendered once. This can be important for pages that are frequently visited, such as landing pages and product pages.
* **Flexibility:** Server-side rendering is more flexible than static generation, because it is possible to dynamically generate content based on user input. This can be important for pages that need to be personalized for each user, such as blog posts and news articles.
* **SEO:** Static generation can improve SEO, because the pages are rendered on the server and can be indexed by search engines. Server-side rendering can also improve SEO, but it is important to use a technique called **pre-rendering** to ensure that the pages are rendered before they are indexed.

Ultimately, the best way to decide whether to use static generation or server-side rendering is to experiment with both methods and see which one works best for your application.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between static generation and server-side rendering:

| Feature | Static Generation | Server-side Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Faster | Slower |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | More flexible |
| SEO | Can improve SEO | Can improve SEO with pre-rendering |

I hope this helps!
